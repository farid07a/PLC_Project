Polymorphism:
    Method Overriding:
        we have child class have same methode in parent class
        parent class animal:
            makeSound():
        class cat (Animal):
            # overriding
            makeSound():
                print("Myaw")

        class dog(Animal):
            # overriding
            makeSound():
                print("how")

    Method Overloading
        # Single Action in different ways
        # like interface by many implementation
        # interface is method shared between classes to communicate between this classes
        # common interface to avoid coupling with classes
        class math:

            def sum(x,y):
                return (x+y)

            def sum (x,y,z)
                return x+y+z
